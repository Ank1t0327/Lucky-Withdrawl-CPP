# Lucky-Withdrawl-CPP
Console-based C++ game project using random number generation and user interaction.

Lucky Withdrawl is a simple, interactive console-based game written in C++. This is my first C++ project that I'm sharing on GitHub as part of my programming journey. I'm currently learning C++ and exploring how to build fun, beginner-friendly programs that reinforce the core concepts I'm studying.


ðŸ”¹ About the Game
In Lucky Withdrawl, the player is invited to test their luck by playing a series of reward-based rounds. Each round produces a random outcome, where the player can win exciting (fictional) prizes or walk away empty-handed. It's a game purely driven by chance and made to entertain.

ðŸ§  Concepts Used
iostream for input/output

ctime to seed the random generator

rand() to generate random prizes

if, switch, and for loop constructs

Basic user interaction and game flow control


ðŸ“Œ
This is a beginner-level project created for learning and fun.
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
